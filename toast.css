  $TOAST-GRID
  An insane grid.
  You'd be mad to use it.
  Usage
  =====
  Assuming default values:
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="grid__col grid__col--1-of-2">
      A half-width column.
    </div>
    <div class="grid__col grid__col--1-of-4 grid__col--pull-1-of-4">
      A quarter, pulled left by its own width. You get this, right?
    </div>
  </div>
  Customisation
  =============
  $toast-grid-namespace and $toast-grid-column-namespace
  adjusts the class names for the grid. With
  default values, grid wrappers have a class
  of '.grid' and columns '.grid__col'.
  $toast-col-groups(n) adjusts column divisions.
  For example, $toast-col-groups(12) will produce
  a 12-column grid. $col-groups(3,6,8)
  will produce a 3-, 6-, and 8-column grid.
  $toast-gutter-width is—you guessed it—the gutter
  width. Accepts any unit.
  That's it. Have fun.
