	<p>For this challenge we were assigned to make the LED light up in two ways. Also we needed to have proof of when the light buld lit up and when it didn't lit up. On the far left hand side the GRN wire is replaced the wrong place which is in the portion of the breadboard therefore the light bulb does not light up. As for the photo on the bottom left hand side the light bult has a positive and negative side, and when they are pluged in the wrong way on the bars of the breadboard makes the light bult not light up.  </p>

	<p>In challenge 1 we made a LED light up using python code to do a sequence. Although we did not use any remixing of the python code but it was able to work and turn off and on from the "time lapse" with the help of "importing time" at the very beginning of our code.  </p>

	<p> In challenge 2 we had to make the LED light up using python and the difference we made in making it blink was using a "RAW" which allows the user to get inside the terminal and set a demand while the LED is in the bar and line 18. We set our LED to light up and do a mini light show for about 5 seconds when pressed the key "a".  </p>
